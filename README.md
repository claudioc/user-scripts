# Collection of my Violentmonkey scripts

[Violent Monkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) is a browser extension that allows you to run JavaScript scripts against any website you may visit, so to have them conform more to your liking ;)

Unfortunately these can only make your life better if you are using websites and not, of course, Apps on mobile.

This is the scripts I personally wrote for myself:

- Facebook: anti reload
  Avoid Facebook to automatically reload their news feed each time you switch to its tab. This behaviour is _so_ annoying and now it's gone.
- Twitter: remove clutter
  I don't use twitter anymore so I don't know if this is still working, but it's just a way to remove everything from the UI that's not just the feed
